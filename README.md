<h4>The smartest UI/DX kit for React Native!</h4>

## This package is on early dev stage. Don't use it yet. This readme is a draft.

There are great known components libs like React Native Elements, React Native Paper... but there are always aspects on them that makes me not think they don't exactly fit my use cases.


This is opinionated. The objective of this is to allow me have a way greater productivity, so I can create more apps in a lower timeframe, and as long projects (>6m) are very tiring, and more apps = more money!


#### It uses:

```
react-native-mask-text
react-hook-forms
react-native-size-matters
@expo/vector-icons
react-native-shadow-2
@react-navigation
pagescrollview
```


## Installation

### Expo
```
expo install react-native-gev react-native-safe-area-context react-native-reanimated
```


## Philosophy
* Opinionated
* Quick and effortless to setup
* Quick to get your app done
* Developer Experience (DX) centered
* Combines the best libs
* Bleeding edge technologies, no legacy nonsenses.
* Expo support (and suggested!)
* Simplifies and automates common patterns
* Easy customization
* Powerful theming
* Follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), breaking / UI changes are majors. (Not yet on v0), future proof


## Info
* The `/src` is intentionally shipped with the package. This ensures you will always have access to the source code for your installed version.
* Some patterns and components were based / built on top of others libs, so this has the best current practices. When they do, they have their source properly linked, with all the respect to the authors and to their licenses. This aims to improve them and make them fit better this project.

## Usage

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## TODO add a builtin way to locally store data using another lib.
