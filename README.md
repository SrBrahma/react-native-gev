## This README and the package itself still early dev stage. I am already using it but I don't have time to properly publish it now.

There are great known components libs like React Native Elements, React Native Paper... but there are always aspects on them that makes me not think it's that good.



I don't aim to make this too much generic. This is actually very opinated. The objective of this is to allow me have a way greater productivity, so I can create more apps in a lower timeframe, and as long projects (>6m) are very tiring, and more apps = more money!

It uses:
```
react-native-mask-text
react-hook-forms
react-native-size-matters
@expo/vector-icons
react-native-shadow-2
@react-navigation
```


The `/src` is intentionally shipped with the package.

## Installation
```bash
npm install react-native-gev
# or
yarn add react-native-gev
```

## Usage

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## TODO add a builtin way to locally store data using another lib.
