## This readme and the package itself are on heavy early dev stage. Don't use it yet.

There are great known components libs like React Native Elements, React Native Paper... but there are always aspects on them that makes me not think it's that good.


I don't aim to make this too much generic. This is actually very opinated. The objective of this is to allow me have a way greater productivity, so I can create more apps in a lower timeframe, and as long projects (>6m) are very tiring, and more apps = more money!

It uses:
```
react-native-mask-text
react-hook-forms
react-native-size-matters
@expo/vector-icons
react-native-shadow-2
@react-navigation
```

Some stuff were based/built on top of react-native-paper, as they have some good solutions.

The `/src` is intentionally shipped with the package.

## Installation

## Expo users:
```
expo install react-native-safe-area-context
``` [add rest]

```bash
npm install react-native-gev
# or
yarn add react-native-gev
```

## Usage

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## TODO add a builtin way to locally store data using another lib.
